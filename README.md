# SparkIOSmartToy
During a hardware hackathon we developed a smart teddybear.

We used multiple sensors to determine how the child was playing with the toy and responded with multiple outputs. 

For inputs, we used proximity and pressure sensors. 

For outputs, we added a propeller that turned on for a few seconds when the child walked away from the toy. We also had lights that went off while the child was petting the toy. We wanted to add a speaker and text notification to the parent while the child was playing with the toy, but didn't have enough time to accomplish this. 

Definitely looking forward to more developments with the Spark Core IO.
